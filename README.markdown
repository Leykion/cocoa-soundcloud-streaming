Cocoa SoundCloud stream player
==============================

This is the extracted stream player I created for an iPhone project.  
It's very basic in it's functionality and you're invited to add all the features that you might need.


Basic Usage
-----------

### Including the lib into your project
You can either include the source files into your project or open the project and build the 'SCAudioStream' target to get you a compiled version of the lib.
The latter will result in a static lib as a fat binary (build for the device and the simulator) in a directory called 'Dist'. Here you'll also find the header files for the lib (in fact it's just one header file 'SCAudioStream.h').
Link the library and also link the AudioToolbox framework.

### Using the lib
For every stream you want to play you create an instance of SCAudioStream.

    SCAudioStream *stream = [[SCAudioStream alloc] initWithURL:streamURL delegate:self];

Don't forget to implement the delegate protocol 'SCAudioStreamDelegate'. This protocol only specifies one method which is used to sign requests if you're about to play oauth protected streams.
